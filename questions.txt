1. In Js, What are the differences between == and === ?

Both of them mean equal values. But === mean same type too. 
Eg: '1' == 1 => true
    '1' === 1 => false



2. Look at the code below in Javascript, you have a for loop if you have setTimeout inside it.
If log the loop counter inside setTimeout, what will be logged?
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
setTimeout(function() {
console.log(i);
}, 5000);
}

The counter will be log 10 times from 0 to 9 but with 5 seconds delay.


3. Can you please give a few improvements brought by ES6 ?

-Blocked-scoped variables, const and let
-Arrow functions
-Classes
-String interpolation, eg `${foo} is a variable`
-Promises for asynchronicity
-async/await for async functions
-import/export
...


4. What is Git stash made for ?

Git stash is used to save local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the head commit.
It is usefull if you you want to work on another branch from a clean state but you don't want to  validate current work beacause it is dirty.
